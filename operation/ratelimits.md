# Internal Rate Limits

In order to ensure that users can't build alerts which use up all your sending capacity,
and to reduce impact of hitting any global rate limits of discord or telegram, Poracle
has a built in rate limiting system.

In the above defaults you can see that every 4 minutes (240 seconds), any user that receives
more than 20 alerts will have their messaging paused until the end of the period.

Channels can have a different (usually higher) rate limit - but it still makes sense to
have a sensible limit here in case of an explosion of messages (eg raid hour, special
events, or change in spawn)

If a user hit the rate limit `maxLimitsBeforeStop` times in a 24-hour period they will be
told of their suspension and can `!start` again once they have fixed their tracking.
If you set `disableOnStop` then a user will be permanently disabled and need to come grovelling for
you to re-enable their account.

# Discord Rate Limits

Discord limits are per route

Webhook limits 

# Telegram Rate Limits

Like Discord, telegram limits are per route. 

Telegram [says](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this):

_"If you're sending bulk notifications to multiple users, the API will not allow more than 30 messages per second or so. Consider spreading out notifications over large intervals of 8â€”12 hours for best results._

_Also note that your bot will not be able to send more than 20 messages per minute to the same group._

_The API will not allow bulk notifications to more than ~30 users per second, if you go over that, you'll start getting 429 errors"_
