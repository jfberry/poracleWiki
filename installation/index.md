# Installation

PoracleJS has two documented install paths, manual and docker. Both options provide easy and convenient ways to build your environment. Docker allows for quicker and easier setup but requires you to know how to edit docker-compose files if you wish to change anything. Manual allows for more fine-tuning but requires a great degree of knowledge to install and configure.

 * [Manual](manual)
 * [Docker](docker)
