# Config file

Poracle's main configuration file is `local.json`. You will also notice a 
`default.json` in the config directory. This is updated by the developers and
should not be changed - Poracle will first look to your local.json file and then
if it can't find a setting the reasonable defaults provided by default.json

## Validating the file
After making changes to the file we should ensure it is valid JSON. If it is not valid JSON PoracleJS will not start. The default format resembles cJSON which does not have an online linter. You may be able to put it into your browsers developer tools to ensure it is valid JSON.
