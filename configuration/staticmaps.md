Poracle can be configured in a variety of different ways to support
tiles in output.  Whilst most commonly in use for discord notifications,
they are more commonly being used in some telegram contexts
(for example weather changes)

Because of the flexible dts, you can build a direct link to a tileserver
if you want, or you can use the ``{{staticMap}}`` calculated URL
which Poracle will do the heavy lifting for you.

For best results, the recommendation is to use a SwiftTileServer and
set Poracle to use the `tileservercache` option (see below) - as this
causes the tile to be pregenerated and therefore instantly available
to users.  

For telegram, the trick is to include the map as a URL link with a blank
link title - ie put ``[\u200A]({{{staticMap}}})`` in your template and
set `webpage_preview` to True. You can see this in the example DTS for
weatherchange.

# Static Maps

Poracle supports five different staticmaps services for displaying little maps below your alarms by using `{{{staticMap}}}`

## TileServerCache

That's the option for a self hosted TileServerCache server. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/123FLO321/SwiftTileserverCache). 

You need to copy the templates located in `tileservercache_templates/` into the `Templates/` directory of your Tileserver so
that Poracle has access to the templates it needs to generate the tiles.
