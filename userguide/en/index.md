# Poracle

Poracle is a bot which supports configurable alarms and notifications for events that the scanner sees.  Poracle decides 
which incoming data will be interesting and forwards the data to interested parties.

This means every user can feed Poracle manually with filtering settings to generate personalized output. There are two 
different ways to access data. Poracle can be set up in group chats and channels, but users can also use it in their own 
private messages.
